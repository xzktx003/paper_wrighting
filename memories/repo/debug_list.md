# Debug List

## 2026-05-22 - Restart script resolved app paths under `scripts/`

- Symptom: `sh scripts/restart.sh` tried to enter `scripts/app/apps/frontend` and `scripts/app/apps/backend`, then reported success against an already-running service.
- Root cause: the script treated its own directory as the repository root.
- Fix: derive `REPO_ROOT` from `scripts/..`, validate expected directories before restart, detach the backend start with `setsid` when available, and add a shell regression test for root and `scripts/` invocation paths.

## 2026-05-22 - Project delete failed when `project.json` was missing

- Symptom: deleting project `c2b87dfc-af29-42ef-b088-0f28aa9d65c3` returned HTTP 500 with `ENOENT` while opening `papers/<id>/project.json`.
- Root cause: the soft-delete route read `project.json` unconditionally before marking the project as trashed.
- Fix: make project deletion tolerant of missing or invalid metadata by writing a minimal trashed metadata file when the project directory still exists, and treat already-removed project directories as successful no-ops.
- Regression: added a Fastify route test and a Playwright delete-flow script. On this machine, browser launch is blocked by missing GTK/ATK system libraries, so the Playwright script falls back to Playwright APIRequest validation.
